# Understanding the two files
* The first file, `code.cpp`, is what I used to write the program and test it  
* The second file, `leetcode.cpp`, is what I have submitted on leetcode.com, with all of the extra debugging info removed, to make it run as fast and with the least amount of memory as possible
